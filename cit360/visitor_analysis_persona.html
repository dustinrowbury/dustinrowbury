            <h2>Site Contrast</h2>
            <h3>Walmart VS. My BYUI Mobile Sites</h3>


            <p>1.	The unfriendly mobile site was My BYUI and the friendly was Walmart.  </p>
            <p>2.	In this case they did an okay job hitting the target audience since my BYUI has a pretty easy time knowing who their target audience.</p>
            <p>3.	Walmart Did a very good job they know that if someone was looking on their site on their mobile device chances are they are looking for something specific and they want it fast. Walmart accommodate by making the mobile website very simple. My BYUI on the other hand didn’t change theirs at all, they didn’t seem to even care about making what is most commonly used easily available, nope they just left it how it was</p>
            <p>4.	Organization wasn’t bad on My BYUI because it is the same as the regular site. Walmart however made it nice and easy as soon as you get to the page they provide a search bar</p>
            <p>5.	The best site Walmart was very easy to access and scrolling was very simple all you had to do was scroll up and down or if you found a subject that interested you swipe left and right to see more like it. Very nice and easy to use on a mobile device. My BYUI however was not the same it was quite difficult to use right from the start of the page even if you know where the tab is you need to click on it is too small to click on and then you must zoom in and scroll to the left then up and hope to not get lost. This was a very difficult page to navigate</p>


            <p>URL:
                <a href="https://www.walmart.com/">https://www.walmart.com/</a><br>This was a very easy to use site.<br>
                Then there was My BYUI
                URL:<a href="https://my.byui.edu/ics">https://my.byui.edu/ics</a><br>This was a site that I will never go back to on a mobile device unless I have to.

                <h2>Visitor Analysis</h2>
                <p>1. The places that I visited that did a good job were from all age, classes and educational levels, in the US.</p>
                <p>2. Manty time sites have lots of extra stuff on the pages, but on these they changed that. They took away all the non-important things like side links, most advertisements and extra menu drop downs. That made Walmart’s site much more traversable on a mobile device. On the Wikipedia web site they made it really simple they made it simple and gets you right to the  information that I was looking for. Less really is more when you are on a mobile device.</p>
                <p>3. People who went to Walmart would find it very easy not only to navigate but also to search it is simple and helps you find just what you are looking for with no clutter. All you do is click and search and poof what you were looking for. The drop down menus were not overly complex and also provided a good UX.</p>
                <p>4. I really enjoy the functionality with touch screens and the ability that Walmart gives its customers to see more by swiping I know for me it is more fun than clicking. All the windows were made touch and swipe friendly. Other than the information Wiki wasn’t too exciting but the simplicity was nice and made being on the site bearable. </p>
                <p>5. It did facilitate usage both Wiki and Walmart, they had an easily locatable search bar even on the mobile edition f the site and there was nothing that got in the way or took up the whole screen. It was a satisfying experience that was worry free.</p>
